Thanks to our community members who contributed features and bug fixes to this release! If you are a mod author who finds their mod no longer works with Sodium 0.7, please [open an issue](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/issues) so that we can work with you to fix it.\n\nThis is an overview of the biggest changes in this release:\n\n- Complex translucent geometry, such as waterlogged stained glass panes and many types of modded blocks, are now correctly rendered with no measurable performance impact in typical scenarios. We've implemented a quad splitting approach into our translucency sorting solution, resulting in perfect translucency even where it was previously not possible. This provides a significant improvement in graphical fidelity in vanilla and modded scenarios.\n- Many aspects of the chunk meshing task system have been updated to work independently of the frame rate. This means even at lower frame rates or with few threads chunks will be meshed without delay or overloading. Our carefully tuned scheduler uses machine learning to improve frame time stability even when loading new chunks.\n- Terrain rendering itself has received some optimizations that improve the frame rate for some systems, and when the camera is not moving by using a new per-region cache.\n- New optimizations to entity and particle rendering improve performance in heavy scenes.\n\n# New Optimizations and Features\n\n- Added translucency sorting with quad splitting to correctly display intersecting and complex geometry (douira)\n- Improved performance of terrain rendering on some systems (combined draw commands) (douira)\n- Improved performance of terrain rendering when the camera is not moving (draw batch caching) (douira)\n- Improved performance of entity rendering by faster vertex sorting (JellySquid)\n- Improved chunk load performance & frame stability by task effort estimation and frame-rate independent task scheduling (douira)\n- Improved frame time stability by limiting the uploaded chunks using size estimation (douira)\n- Improved performance of particle rendering (MoePus)\n\n# Changes and Fixes\n\n- Reduced unnecessary memory usage in the upload buffer (IMS, douira)\n- Optimized and fixed some block models (muzikbike)\n- Improved accessibility, correctness, and translatability of the options (MeeniMc, Madis0, contariaa)\n- Added debug mode and safety features to prevent and detect off-thread rendering bugs (JellySquid)\n- Improved mod compatibility with the sprite animation optimizations (contariaa)\n\n# Other Bugs Fixed\n\n- Fixed small memory leak (JellySquid)\n- Fixed some bugs with translucency sorting at large coordinates and with some specific geometry (douira)\n- Fixed terrain rendering when the camera is outside the loaded area using bitmap trees (douira)\n- Fixed jittery fog animation (cortex, douira)\n- Fixed multiple bugs with missed chunk updates and race conditions

We recommend that players and mod pack authors update to this version, as some changes can significantly improve performance and stability.\n\n## Mod Compatibility\n\nSpecial care has been taken to minimize the number of breaking changes for other mods, so there should be few issues upgrading to this release for the vast majority of users. However, there are some exceptions:\n\n- ⚠️ If using the _Indium_ mod, you must update to version 1.0.36 or newer.\n- ⚠️ If using the _Iris_ mod, you must update to version 1.7.6 or newer.\n\n## Highlights\n\n- The quality of terrain rendering has been significantly improved (adding greater vertex and texture precision). This fixes many issues with special block models, and especially with modded content. With large mod packs or resource packs, there is significantly reduced texture bleeding between blocks when compared to the previous release.\n- Virtual memory utilization has been dramatically reduced while loading chunks. This can have a large impact on how quickly chunks are loaded on the client, and on many systems, can reduce the amount of micro-stutter significantly.\n- Improved performance on integrated Intel GPUs significantly with additional terrain rendering optimizations (up to 10-15% faster, depending on the render distance) and enhanced framebuffer copies (up to 3-5% faster, regardless of render distance).\n- Occlusion culling has been improved slightly, reducing the number of rendered sections by up to 10-15%, especially when using higher render distances.\n- All improvements for hardware and driver compatibility from Sodium 0.6+ have been back-ported in this release, helping to improve the user experience considerably.\n\n## Other changes\n- Fixed the handling of sub-texel offsets in terrain rendering, which caused texture seams to appear between blocks when very large texture atlases were used (common in large mod packs).\n- Fixed a problem where z-fighting would occur with some block overlays, such as emissive textures.\n- Fixed the rendering of block models which have quads with different shading modes (i.e. VT's Bushy Leaves, Bray's World...)\n- Fixed an issue where some chunks would not render correctly immediately after the projection matrix was changed (such as when putting down a Spyglass.)\n- Fixed a bug where very large block entities in nearby chunk sections would be incorrectly culled.\n- Startup warnings about incompatible NVIDIA or Intel GPU driver versions will now only be shown if the GPU is actually in use.\n- Error messages at startup are more helpful now, especially when showing errors about incompatible graphics drivers.\n- Fixed a crash at startup with ARM CPUs on Windows that don't support OpenGL without the use of a translation layer.\n- Fixed a bug that prevented the \"Help\" button in dialog boxes from opening the default web browser on Windows.\n- Fixed many issues around the handling of chunks with large amounts of geometry, fixing some rare crashes and graphical issues.\n- Added a workaround for users who have installed ASUS GPU Tweak III on their computer, since it causes extremely poor performance and crashes with Minecraft.\n- Improved the driver workarounds for NVIDIA GPUs on Windows, potentially improving performance on laptops with hybrid graphics.\n- Improved compatibility with some resource packs that use custom shaders in entity rendering.\n- Added support for the Sprite Tracking API (originally introduced in Sodium 0.6.9.)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2025-02-26T00:54:03.278312Z","downloads":227402,"version_type":"beta","status":"listed","requested_status":null,"files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8f6bdf3c1fe2737f819fd4f186f5d89ad68d2e51","sha512":"e6906b77e709c17bfe445d065353010853cad58a65252f70f9e7e06113156f21c85e91a71e5ccebb4ea0f0168280737bb12ae407e115a9f1df3b5e8d21b87ec5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/versions/ryOMVRuG/sodium-fabric-0.5.12-beta.2%2Bmc1.20.1.jar","filename":"sodium-fabric-0.5.12-beta.2+mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":971376,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[]},{"game_versions":["1.21.4"],"loaders":["neoforge"],"id":"GUEd3mz0","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"TEZXhE2U","featured":false,"name":"Sodium 0.6.9 for NeoForge 1.21.4","version_number":"mc1.21.4-0.6.9-neoforge","changelog":"- Fixed the handling of sub-texel offsets in terrain rendering, which caused texture seams to appear between blocks when very large texture atlases were used (common in large mod packs).\n- On macOS, fixed an issue that would cause texture seams to frequently appear between most blocks, regardless of what mods or texture packs are used.\n- Fixed an issue that caused textures on cross-block models (such as Flowers) and block overlays (such as the side of Grass Blocks) to be misaligned.\n- Fixed an issue that caused textures on different faces of the same block to appear misaligned with each other.\n- Fixed an issue that caused textures to appear slightly too zoomed-in on some blocks.\n- Added a utility class which other mods can use to ensure their animated textures are updated correctly when using custom rendering.\n    -

0.6.0 for NeoForge 1.21.1","version_number":"mc1.21.1-0.6.0-neoforge","changelog":"This is the largest update to Sodium since the initial release! There are a countless number of improvements for mod compatibility and hundreds of bugs and other issues have been resolved. Additionally, we managed to pack some new performance optimizations into this release.\n\n## Key highlights of this release\n\n- **This is the first multi-loader release for both NeoForge _and_ Fabric!** Yes, seriously!\n  - In the long-term, this means that users and mod authors will no longer need to rely on third-party forks of Sodium (Rubidium, Embeddium, Xenon, etc). This will greatly reduce friction for everyone, and improve the overall user experience significantly.\n  - We are working with mod authors as quickly as possible to implement additional APIs to improve mod compatibility with this version. Where possible, we will try to submit patches upstream to other mods to minimize the effort needed. If you are a mod author who finds their mod no longer works with Sodium 0.6, please [open an issue](<https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/issues>) so that we can work with you to fix it.\n- **The Fabric Rendering API (FRAPI) is now supported out of the box!** This greatly improves mod compatibility, and makes it so mods like _Indium_ are no longer necessary. We've worked with individuals in the Fabric team and other mod authors to make sure our implementation works correctly, and have done comprehensive testing to ensure other mods behave correctly with our implementation. (That said, if you find a bug with it as a mod author, please let us know.)\n- **Major improvements for translucent blocks!** You know the long-standing issues with stained glass and other blocks, and how they don't quite look right? We're happy to announce those issues are no more. This means that translucent blocks will look great-- much better than Vanilla even-- with almost no performance impact. (This achievement would not have been possible without the effort of [Douira](https://douira.dev/). This was such a complex issue that it became the subject of their master's thesis.)\n\n## Improvements and new optimizations\n\n- Occlusion culling has been improved slightly, reducing the number of rendered sections by up to 10-15% when using higher render distances.\n- Added a new optimization called \"Material Downgrading\" which moves some terrain geometry to a simpler render pass when the texture is not transparent or translucent.

This will greatly reduce friction for everyone, and improve the overall user experience significantly.\n  - We are working with mod authors as quickly as possible to implement additional APIs to improve mod compatibility with this version.

You may have to wait for an update from the authors of those mods.\n\n## Highlights\n\n- **Dramatically improved the performance of terrain rendering in nearly every way.**\n  - Chunk loading is dramatically faster, uses much fewer resources (both CPU and RAM), and should feel much smoother than before.\n    - The amount of time needed to load new chunks (referred to as \"meshing\") has been greatly reduced, and is anywhere from 40% to 60% faster than the previous release.\n    - Memory allocation rate while loading the geometry for new chunks has been decreased by around 80%. \n  - Occlusion culling is anywhere from 25-45% faster now, and the long-standing bugs with it have also been fixed\n    - You've probably experienced those issues where certain parts of the world don't seem to render when looked at from certain angles. Well, those issues are fixed now!\n  - Terrain rendering now uses shared index buffers which can reduce video memory bandwidth/usage requirements by up to 25%.\n- **Fixed major performance regressions NVIDIA graphics cards.**  (anywhere from 200% to 300% faster than previous release...)\n    - If you were previously disappointed by the performance you were getting on a NVIDIA GPU, try this version.\n- \"Render Pass Consolidation\" has been added, which greatly reduces the number of render passes needed for the world (hugely improves CPU and GPU utilization.) This also helps to prevent excessive amounts of overdraw, and ensures larger batches of geometry are sent to the GPU for rendering.\n- \"Block Face Culling\" has been significantly improved, which allows for more blocks to be eligible for early geometry culling (hugely improves GPU utilization.) This generally makes the biggest difference in foliage-heavy scenes.\n- Many other performance enhancements which are too numerous to describe here.\n\n## Other notable changes\n\n- A lot of issues with biome color blending have been fixed. This means it is no longer incorrectly applied to certain blocks, especially those from other mods. Additionally, it's much faster to calculate the colors used by certain blocks, which helps improve world load times.\n- A lot of issues were also fixed with smooth lighting! This should fix some issues with certain resource packs, and the lighting with blocks like Sculk Sensors.\n- Mip-mapping has been greatly improved so that terrain no longer has a black outline around certain textures when viewed at extreme angles. (Note: This has the consequence that some textures, such as those used for leaves, may seem slightly brighter than they did before. However, we think this generally looks more accurate to the original texture work, and believe the original behavior was a bug.) \n- When supported, the mod will now request a \"No Error Context\", which allows the graphics driver to skip some unnecessary CPU overhead during rendering. This slightly helps improve performance on some graphics card drivers.\n- A new driver compatibility and workarounds system has been implemented, which helps to inform the user of possible performance issues & automatically fix them. \n- Line rendering (used by things like Structure Blocks and Hitbox Rendering) is no longer broken.\n- ... Many other improvements for mod compatibility.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-05T00:13:51.574004Z","downloads":245944,"version_type":"release","status":"listed","requested_status":null,"files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3c032c494f6d38019b4dcbcd13e6a0fe1f172403","sha512":"506c80ffc90219cff0983b74d9774b892b4a5dd1d60d79cd2972b56dd38bb7d2a2a624be995c9782bae6775b89b4d753227759d6d84e7570986793d245a249de"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/versions/hiO9bwqc/sodium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.5.0.jar","filename":"sodium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.5.0.jar","primary":true,"size":820730,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"yM94ont6","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"incompatible"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"VOYxIjFI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"incompatible"}]},{"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"id":"vgceLbdH","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"DzLrfrbK","featured":false,"name":"Sodium 0.4.10","version_number":"mc1.20-0.4.10","changelog":"Updated for Minecraft 1.20.

chunk rendering backend has been introduced, bringing the best performance yet to any hardware that can run Minecraft. \n- Added support for some Fabric API features, such custom fluid rendering and blocks with attached data.\n- Many improvements to how we use and allocate VRAM, reducing stutters caused by loading chunks and overall GPU memory usage.\n- Additionally, chunk loading was improved to prevent overload and to better stabilize frame rates. This can help with loading into worlds or when many blocks are changing at once.\n- Improved the amount of time it takes to rebuild the chunk graph. This can reduce lag associated with moving around in the world or loading chunks at higher render distances. \n- Many new optimizations for high resolution texture packs, especially when animated textures are used.\n- Fixes and improvements for fog effects during sunrise/sunset and while underwater, helping to improve visuals drastically.\n- Reduced VRAM usage in ocean biomes and other environments with lots of water. \n- Support for custom translations (to be added in a future release)\n- Improvements to particle rendering/culling, helping performance in particle heavy servers.\n- Additional optimizations for biome color blending.\n- ... and many other smaller, miscellaneous optimizations specific to Minecraft 1.17.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2021-07-17T20:29:41.734817Z","downloads":43746,"version_type":"release","status":"listed","requested_status":null,"files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"4cc166a86f8cb20983ac85950f6c8b58eed9fa3b","sha512":"000d00496ed4e945c4d8c4d6b70584ffec5af6034c39e22d3ccc69734ccaadd37e7e9d31129da84c82d08798416a1a8daaf305656fa46406738a36505b7fd2e7"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/versions/mc1.17.1-0.3.0/sodium-fabric-mc1.17.1-0.3.0%2Bbuild.5.jar","filename":"sodium-fabric-mc1.17.1-0.3.0+build.5.jar","primary":true,"size":563344,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[]},{"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5"],"loaders":["fabric"],"id":"YAGZ1cCS","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"TEZXhE2U","featured":true,"name":"Sodium 0.2.0","version_number":"mc1.16.5-0.2.0","changelog":"This is the first major release of Sodium since launch, so there are nearly a year's worth of improvements and bug fixes in this one! Hardware support has been greatly improved, and there's been many new optimizations to help out everyone.\n\n### Highlights\n- Added a new and optimized system for vertex writing. Depending on the situation, significant performance improvements can be seen for both [block entity rendering](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/791199652410032150/792627201463287818/unknown.png), [mob rendering](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/791199652410032150/792627353401950208/unknown.png), and text rendering.\n- Improved hardware support for AMD and Intel GPUs on Windows, allowing the use of multi-draw rendering where it was otherwise broken in the past. Multi-draw chunk rendering can drastically improve frame rates where supported.\n- Switched to using the new ThinGL library, which allows Sodium code to use a stateless abstraction over OpenGL. This helps to improve performance, mod compatibility, stability, and future compatibility with Minecraft 1.17.\n- Preparing chunk updates for rendering now takes much less time by better taking advantage of multi-threading, greatly improving frame times while loading or updating chunks.\n- Many new optimizations for our chunk graph and culling algorithm, helping to reduce CPU load and improve frame rates while playing.\n- Improved compatibility with many mods depending on additional block data to be available during chunk building, such as LambdaBetterGrass.\n- Added an API other mods can use to disable Sodium features. Sometimes, incompatibilities can arise, but mods supporting this functionality can ask Sodium to disable specific parts of itself automatically to avoid these.\n- Fixed large memory leaks that could occur when unloading and loading many worlds repeatedly.\n- Fixed terrain stitching issues caused by high-resolution texture packs and exotic block models.   \n- Fixed some issues with smooth block and entity lighting, notably with emissive properties.\n- Fixed issues where the top-face of fluids would disappear at certain camera angle, or while inside a fluid.\n- Fixed many issues causing chunks not to update or appear when looking in certain directions.\n- Issues with render distance and fog effects when using certain mods have been fixed.\n... and much, much more.\n\nYou can find a number of issues that were fixed with this release [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/milestone/2?closed=1).
